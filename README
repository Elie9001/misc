Other useful programs


# fixpaper.c

If you've ever taken a picture of a paper document, and then tried to print it out later, you might notice that the quality sucks.

Fixpaper is a tiny app to clean up the photo and make it nicely printable.
It's faster & easier than using a typical image editing program. Especially if you have a lot of pictures of papers.

Right now it's just a desktop app.
Maybe someday I'll make a version for mobile (Android or iOS). You're free to do that yourself if you want.

It works on Linux.
And probably Windows - but I haven't tested on Windows yet. Try it and let me know.





# xnightfilter.c

Simple night-time screen filter for Linux/X11
It filters out blue light.
You can also invert colors.
